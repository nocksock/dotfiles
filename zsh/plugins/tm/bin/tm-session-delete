# tm-session-delete: delete a session without leaving tmux
#
#   kinda like vim's :bd behaviour. Useful when using tm-qp often just to
#   quickly do something and not wanting to hog a bunch of unused sessions.
#
#   mapping in .tmux.conf:
#       bind -r X run tm-session-delete
#

deletesession=$(tmux display -p "#S")
tmux switch-client -l

if [[ $deletesession == $(tmux display -p "#S") ]]; then
    # switch didn't work, probably was a consecutive call of this script,
    # switching to the previous session instead
    tmux switch-client -p
fi

tmux kill-session -t $deletesession
